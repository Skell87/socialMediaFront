need to get the amin page that i load to to be the login page.
login page needs to clear fields on submit.
create account needs logic to check if username is taken
on create account, user submit button should also redirect to login page after user submission
    maybe set the submit function to have a loading icon, an await for the response, then..
    route to the login page.


dont forget that this is multiuser.
facebook uses websockets that are always listening,
we wont use that, 
we can use polling, creating a function that runs every couple of
seconds to hit the backend and see if theres anything new and
fetches it, this will be important for my own final.

in api, can handle conditional navigation with the .then.
