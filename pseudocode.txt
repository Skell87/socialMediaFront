    username field,
    password entry
    name, first and last.

    set as a baseplate with nothing at first.
    eventually needs text entry field.
        on submit needs to include: 
            author username,
            date posted (refer to notes)
            text content.
    
    needs a feed for all user posts.
        maybe a feed model, user posts information to the backend feed model
        all users have access to see the feed.
